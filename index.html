          <p class="about_text text_justify">
            Kharkiv, one of Ukraine’s largest cities, is rich in history and
            cultural significance was founded in 1654. Its location on the
            crossroads of important trade routes allowed it to develop quickly
            into a bustling commercial and industrial center. By the 18th
            century, Kharkiv had grown into a prominent hub of education and
            culture. The establishment of Kharkiv University in 1804, one of the
            oldest universities in Eastern Europe, attracted scholars,
            intellectuals, and students from across the region. The city’s
            intellectual atmosphere contributed to advancements in literature,
            science, and art throughout the 19th century. During the early 20th
            century, Kharkiv played a pivotal role in Ukraine’s
            industrialization. It became an industrial powerhouse, particularly
            in the fields of machinery and technology. In fact, from 1919 to
            1934, Kharkiv served as the capital of Soviet Ukraine, further
            solidifying its political and economic importance. Throughout the
            20th century, Kharkiv continued to be a significant center for
            scientific research, engineering, and education, with many notable
            achievements in these fields. Its combination of historical depth,
            academic prominence, and industrial development has shaped Kharkiv
            into the modern, vibrant metropolis it is today.

              by its glass facade, and historic cannons and tanks guarding the
              entrance. One of these is a British-made Mark V, dating to 1918
              and captured by Soviets in the Ukrainian War of Independence in
              1919. Holding 300,000 exhibits, the museum is one of the largest
              in its field in Ukraine and in the collection are weapons, medals,
              coins, uniforms, paintings and photographs, all with a focus on
              the War of Independence (1917-1922) and the Second World War

              The Annunciation Cathedral is the most beautiful temple in Kharkiv
              – one of the largest cities in Ukraine and its former capital. The
              history of the cathedral dates back to the 17th century when it
              was not a monumental cathedral, but a small wooden church. In its
              current form, it was rebuilt only in 1789. The temple impresses
              with its solemnity, rich in interior decoration. Great Ukrainian
              artists painted the walls of the Annunciation Cathedral artists.
              This temple is a favorite attraction for tourists not without good
              reason.

              The Assumption Cathedral and its slender bell tower, resembling a
              candle, can be seen from almost anywhere in the city. The
              Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary at 11
              Universitetska str., is the oldest Orthodox church in Kharkiv. The
              church was built back in 1658, but soon the wooden structure was
              dilapidated, and a stone cathedral was built, which has not
              survived to this day. A modern baroque church with elements of
              folk architecture was built in 1777, and completed in 1783. The
              Alexander bell tower (89.5 m) is considered to be the decoration
              of the cathedra
